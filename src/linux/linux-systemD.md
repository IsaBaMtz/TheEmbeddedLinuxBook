# SystemD

**SystemD** is a system that is designed for the Linux Kernel. 

**SystemD** is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. As it replaces the sysvinit process to become the first process, that runs as PID1 and starts the rest of the system.

**SystemD** provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.

**SystemD** also includes a logging daemon, utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname, data, locale, maintain a list of logged-in users and running containers and virtual machines, system accounts, runtime directories and settings, and daemons to manage simple network configuration, network time synchronization, log forwarding, and name resolution.

**SystemD** provides support for automatically reverting to the previous version of the OS or kernel in case the system consistently fails to boot.
